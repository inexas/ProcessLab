<!--
     This file lists the classes you can change in a running JSPWiki
     environment.
     
     The requestedClass can either be a Class or an Interface.  However,
     the mappedClass must always be a concrete Class, which either extends
     or implements requestedClass (depending on whether it is a class or an
     interface).
     
     Note that this does not change static class contents; normal
     inheritance rules apply.
     
     If this file does not define a class mapping, then the requestedClass
     is always instantiated (if it's a concrete class).
     
     Please understand that the contents of this file are not to be changed
     lightly.  It's very easy to break JSPWiki, and this is really meant
     for people who wish to make very deep modifications but don't want
     to be patching their code all the time.
     
     Note that there is no guarantee that your modifications will stay
     compatible between different versions of JSPWiki.  This is really,
     really deeply, invasive stuff we're talking here.  Really, seriously!
     We're not kidding!  We don't even know if this works ourselves!
