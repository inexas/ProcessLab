!! Case history
Nathalie is in charge of the customer inquiries department for a large insurance company. She has 15 people in her team.

Nathalie's job is to keep the customers happy. She has to make sure that inquiries are handled by the right people, correctly and with the minimum of delay. To do this she needs two new reports: 'Inquiry overview', 'Team member/inquiry overview'. The raw data is in the database, somewhere...

! Before ProcessLab
Call IT department, explain request. They send a business analyst. Define requirements. Estimate effort / budget. Plan project. Implement. Test. Deploy. Several weeks, several $1,000's later: Nathalie has report delivered by email as PDF once per week by email. Nathalie happy.

! After ProcessLab
Call Business Engineering department, arrange appointment with Business Engineer. Thursday a.m. the Business Engineer Ralf is at Nathalie's desk. "What do you need exactly?". "You mean [like that|Inquiry overview report]?", "And [how about that|Inquiry By Team report]?". %%teal (Hint: follow the links.)%% Two hours later Nathalie and Ralf head off for a coffee. Nathalie has latest report available on-line whenever she needs it. So do the team. Nathalie %%underline very%% happy.
