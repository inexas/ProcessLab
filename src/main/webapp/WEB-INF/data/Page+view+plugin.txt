The Page View Plugin counts page views and presents the statistics on page views.
The counters themselves are kept in memory and persisted in the work directory,
loading and saving on startup and shutdown.

Three main functionalities are supported:
* invisibly count page views, typically from the TitleBox or Leftmenu
* show the page hits of the current page
* show a list of page hits

Most of the functionality is present in the list format.

The plugin uses the following parameters:
* {{show}} output format, values {{__none__|count|list}}, default is 'none'
* {{count}} count page views?, values {{yes|no}}, default is 'yes' if format equals 'none' and 'no' otherwise

The following parameters are used when format equals list
* {{entries}} maximum number of entries listed
* {{min}} minimum page view count to be listed
* {{max}} maximum page view count to be listed
* {{sort}} sorting method, values {{__name__|count}}, default is 'name'
* {{refer}} regular expression naming pages that have to be referred to to be included in the list. (to list popularity of category pages, use refer='Categories' or even refer='Categor*'.)
* {{include}} filter pagenames to be included in the list
* {{exclude}} filter pagenames to be excluded from the list

* {{plugin body}} defines the content of the generated list, if it contains {{----}} separators the body is split into {{header}}, {{line}}, and {{footer}} which are used to generate the table. Inside the {{line}} portion __{1}__ represents the page name and __{2}__ represents the page view count. {0} represents the (constant) current page name.


An example of the counter in TitleBox would be:
{{{
[{Page view plugin}]
}}}

An example of a table listing the top 50 pageviews excluding the main page and the administrative pages:
{{{
[{PageViewPlugin show='list' sort='count' entries='50' exclude='Main,*Pages'

* [{1}] ({2} views)
}]
}}}

A possible outcome of the above is:
%%quote
* [Category Pineapples|Page view plugin] (101 views)
* [Category Apples|Page view plugin] (66 views)
* [Category Dates|Page view plugin] (42 views)
%%

An example of a table listing the pageviews on categories presenting popularity bars:
{{{
[{PageViewPlugin show='list' refer='Categories' entries=5

%%graphBars
|| Name  || Count
----
|  [{1}] | %%gBar {2} %%
----
%%
}]
}}}

Which renders as:
%%quote
[{PageViewPlugin show='list' sort=count entries=5

%%graphBars
|| Name  || Count
----
|  [{1}] | %%gBar {2} %%
----
%%
}]%%
