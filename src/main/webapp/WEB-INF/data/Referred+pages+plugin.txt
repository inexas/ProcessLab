!Notes

[#1] This plugin uses the PERL regular expression syntax, which is more powerful than the 
standard unix globbing syntax. \\
The main difference is that ''any char'' is matched by means of a explicit dot "{{.}}" ; 
multiple occurences of any char are thus matched by means of "{{.*}}", "{{.+}}" or "{{.?}}". 
\\See also [overview of regular expression syntax|EditFindAndReplaceHelp]

[#2]Hover your mouse over the {{<pagename>}} link and you will see all the settings of the called plugin.

[#3]The whole output of the plugin is enclosed in a {{<div class='ReferredPagesPlugin'>}} tag, 
so you can do any special formatting you want via the jspwiki.css.
