The various visualizations generated by the [DataView plugin] take their raw data from a data source. The data may originate from two places: the body of the plugin itself or a database. The table below illustrates the key differences.

|| || Static data source || Dynamic data source
|| Source |{{{[{DataView format=pie size='100,400'

Product,Quantity
Garmin,21
Tomtom,36
Blaupunkt,21 }]
}}} | {{{[{DataView format=pie db=demo size='100,400'

SELECT name,quantity
FROM products
WHERE id <= 3
}]
}}}

SELECT name,quantity
FROM products
WHERE id <= 3
}]
|| Data only changes when page is edited | Data may change each time the page is loaded and reflects the actual state of the database
|| db   | None | Always has a {{db='xyz'}} parameter which selects the name of the data source as defined in the [DataStar configuration] page
|| Data | Contained in the plugin body | Defined in an SQL query in either a {{sql='sss'}} parameter or in the body of the plugin (shown above)
|| Definition | Data has headers and at least one column | The number of columns and the data type of the column is defined by the SQL query

!!! Data types
When the data is provided statically you must specify the data type of each column. This isn't needed when the data is taken from SQL as the data type is looked up from the column type in the query.

The data may be one of the following types
* string (default)
* number
* boolean
* date

The data types are specified in the column headers like this
{{{
Date:date,Value:number,Comment:string
2009-02-28,52,Keith
}}}

Notes
* In the column headers, the ":string" can be omitted as it is the default value
* If strings contain commas then surround them with "double quote characters, like this"
* And if they contain quotes as well then "quote them, and ""double"" the quotes"


If column contains dates then the data should be formatted as follows...

||Type || Format || Comments || Examples
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD | Date only, 01 is January | 2009-04-30
| Date time | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | Date and time, 24 hour clock | 2009-04-30 15:21:22
| Time | HH:MM:SS | Time only, 24 hour clock | 15:21:22
