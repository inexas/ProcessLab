Dynamic data sources are use by the [DataStar plugins] as a source for data to show in a visualizations. They are 'dynamic' in as much as the data is taken directly out of a database and so could change each time a page is displayed.

Here is an example
{{{
[{DataView db=demo sql='SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS'}]
}}}

The db parameter 'demo' is the data source. The database configuration is set up on the [DataStar configuration] page (note might not have access rights to view this page) and the list of currently accessible data sources can be found using the [DatasourceList plugin].
