!!! User ID control
UserIdPattern and UserIdMessage allow you to control the format of the user IDs that users use to create accounts. The UserIdPattern should be a [regular expression|http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html] and UserIdMessage is an error message that will be displayed when someone enters a user ID that does not match the pattern. 

Likewise UserPasswordPattern and UserPasswordMessage can be used in the same way to validate passwords.

For example
* UserIdPattern = [[A-Za-z][[0-9]{6}
* UserIdMessage = The user ID  must be a single alphabetic character followed by 6 digits, e.g. A123456
* UserPasswordPattern = [[A-Za-z0-9]{6,}
* UserPasswordMessage = The password must be at lease 6 alphanumeric characters
Note if the UserIdPattern is changed then existing user IDs are not affected
