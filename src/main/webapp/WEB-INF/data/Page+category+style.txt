!!! Category popup

''[Page categories] are purely conceptual groupings for organizing the site's contents. To include a page in a category, just link to your chosen category page from the bottom of the page. ''

This style allows to easily get access to category without first navigating to the intermediate ''category'' page itself.

!! Usage:

{{{
  %%category [Category CategoryName]%% 
}}}
The {{%~%category}} style turns an ordinary page link into a pop-up screen which lists all pages referring to the [[CategoryPage]. When you click the link, the ''referenced by'' information of the category page is retrieved from the server.

!! Example:
The following code:
{{{
See also %%category [Category style] and [Category category]%%
}}}

Will render as:

;: See also %%category [Category style] and [Category category]%%
----
[Category category]
