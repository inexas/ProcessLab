!! Parameters
[{InsertPage page='DataView base parameters'}]

!! Data
One row, one column only.

!!! Examples

At Global GPS we have [{
DataView format=text db=demo sql='SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products
}] 
products in our catalogue and in 2008 we sold an average of [{
DataView format=text db=demo sql='SELECT SUM(quantity)/12 FROM lineitems
}]
units a month.
