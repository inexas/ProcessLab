The [DataUpdate plugin] can make changes to a data source. To keep track of the updates, the plugin writes entries to a logging page.

The page name is [DataUpdateLog] and it is formatted in the following way:
{{{
!!! DataUpdate log
This is the DataUpdate log page, blah, blah...

!!! Log
||Date                ||Page    ||User ID ||DB   || SQL
| 2009-10-10 12:34:14 | SandBox | John    | demo |  UPDATE employees SET.... 
| 2009-10-10 12:52:44 | SandBox | John    | demo |  UPDATE employees SET.... 
...
}}}

The logging mechanism looks for the "!!! Log" title and expects a list of table entries as shown. You can change the text before the "!!! Log" line as you wish but not afterwards.
 
By default the last week of logs are kept. At regular intervals the logger checks for entries that are more than 7 days old, if it finds any they are discarded.

Log files over 100k are truncated.
