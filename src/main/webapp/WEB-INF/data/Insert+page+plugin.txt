Insert all or part of a referenced page into the calling page.  

!!! Parameters
* __{{page}}__ - 
* __{{style}}__ - 
* __{{maxlength}}__ - 
* __{{class}}__ - 
* __{{section}}__ - 
* __{{default}}__ - 

!!! Example

If you want to insert a wiki page into another page you use the InsertPage plugin. The following code demonstrates the  basic technique. Of course, first you need the page to be inserted; we'll use [InsertPageTest].
[{TableOfContents}]

!! Inserting an entire page
__This__

{{{
Here, I insert the text of another page:\\
[{InsertPage page=InsertPageTest}]
}}}

__produces this__

Here, I insert the text of another page:\\
[{InsertPage page=InsertPageTest}]

!!! Naming conventions

If the name of the page to be inserted has spaces in it, just enclose it in single quotes:

{{{
[{InsertPage page='Page with spaces'}]
}}}

If the name of the page has a single quote, such as with a possessive like [[Writer's Notes] remember to use the name as stored. That is, remember the capital letter such as [[WriterSNotes].

!!! Inserting a section of a page
If you want to insert a section of a page into another page use a horizontal ruler (four dashes, '-') to part sections.  The page [InsertPageTestSections] contains three sections that is included below:

__This__

{{{
Here, I insert section 3 of another page:\\
[{InsertPage page=InsertPageTestSections section=3}]
}}}

__produces this__

Here, I insert section 3 of another page:\\
[{InsertPage page=InsertPageTestSections section=3}]

!!! Inserting a page into itself - Circular reference
Cyclical dependencies are checked for, so inserting a page into itself won't work. If I try to insert this page into itself you get the entire page along with the error message: "Error: Circular - You can't include a page in itself!".
