!Introduction
This %~%collapse style /% turns ordinary lists into collapsible trees.

Testing the collapible trees .. Thrusday ...Clicking the list item bullets will expand or collapse nested list items.\\
As a bonus, the status of expanded/collapsed nodes are persisted in a browsers cookie, 
so you don't have to redo your clicking when visiting other pages in between.
(cookies are saved for favorites as well as the main page)

%%tab-Implementation
!Implementation

Collapsible lists only work if you have javascript turned on.

The formatting of the bullets is done through CSS. You can change
the look and feel of open/close bullets as you wannt.
Check out {{templates/default/jspwiki.css}} for the CSS stylesheet definitions, section 460-Collapsible-Lists.

* Default list-item bullets are turned off. (''list-style:none;'')
  Additionaly, the list-items get a ''position:relative;'' such that the inserted ''collapse''
  bullets can be positioned correctly.
* Each inserted bullet gets a css selector ''.collapseBullet'', ''collapseOpen'' or ''collapseClose''. 
* These bullets are floated to the left, and shifted 1.5em to the left 
  so that they line up with the previous indentation level.

You may be interested to replace the standard, text-based, bullets by fancy images.
This can easily be done through css updates. Some examples are available in the different {{skin.css}} files.
Notice how the ''overflow:hidden;'' can be used to hide the default bullets and e.g. replace it by some background-images.
