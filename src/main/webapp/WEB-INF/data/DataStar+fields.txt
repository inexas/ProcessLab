Visualization fields give the ability to ask the viewer to provide values for SQL queries. Fields can be embedded in the SQL query that will cause a form to be displayed prompting for the desired values.

!!! Example
Let's say we want to display a pie chart of sales for a limited set of products. We need the user to provide the product IDs - here's how we do it.

----
Please provide a list of product IDs delimited with commas, for example "2, 3, 4".

[{DataView  db=demo format=pie size=s

SELECT name,quantity
FROM products
WHERE id IN (@Product_ID_list@)
}]

----
You can type in 1,2,3 and click on the submit button to see the result.

!!! Source
The source to do that is:
{{{
[{DataView format=pie size=s db=demo

SELECT name,quantity
FROM products
WHERE id IN (@Product_ID_list@)
}]
}}}

!!! Rules
* A field must start and end with the '@' character. Everything between the two '@' characters is the field ''name''
* Field names must start with a letter and contain letters or numbers or underlines. No spaces please
* Field names are case sensitive
* Fields may appear anywhere in the SQL statement. You could, for example write the following: sql='SELECT * FROM @TableName@' which would allow the viewer to select which table's contents were used in the visualization
