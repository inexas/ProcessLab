ProcessLab supports multiple levels of __authentication__ and trust. Users can be anonymous, have "asserted" identities using cookies, be authenticated, or be administrators:

|| Status || Description || The User greeting Shows..
| Anonymous | User not logged in, and has not supplied a cookie | "G'day (anonymous guest)"
| Asserted | User's browser contains a cookie | "G'Day, ''username'' (not logged in)"
| Authenticated | User logged in with a login id and password | "G'Day, ''username'' (authenticated)"

Depending on the default security policy and page access controls in place, users may (or may not) be required to authenticate. 

When a user decides to log in — or is challenged to do so by a page access control or security policy — he or she sees a standard web form with a username field and a masked password field. After receiving the submitted web form, ProcessLab attempts to log the user.

!!! Lost password

If you lose your password, you can ask to have a new, random password sent to the mail address stored in your User Profile.

!!! Register new user
ProcessLab includes a basic self-registration page that allows users to set up and manage their own profiles.

By default, the form asks for:
* A user ID
* A password
* The user's desired "public name" (e.g., John Smith)
* E-mail address. This can be used when you need to reset your password. (see Lost Password)

When the user saves the profile, ProcessLab checks to make sure that the new user id, wiki name and full name aren't already used by someone else. If so, the user is given the opportunity to choose different values.

After a user creates a wiki profile, he or she may edit it at a later date via the ''My Prefs'' link. By default, users must be authenticated to edit their own profiles...
