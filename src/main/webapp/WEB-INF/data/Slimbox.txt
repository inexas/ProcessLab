!!!Slimbox

The attachment viewer has been replaced by the amazing Slimbox. It allows to preview images as an overlay on the current page. As a bonus, Slimbox is also available as a style to beef up your wiki pages with this cool attachment viewer.

! Usage:
Put the style around a set of image links. Each viewable image will get a clickable %%(font-size:1.4em; font-weight:bold; color:blue;)&raquo;/% marker in front. Click it to enter the slimbox viewer. Navigate through the gallery with the arrow keys. Exit the viewer by {{Esc}}, the close button or clicking outside the image panel.
