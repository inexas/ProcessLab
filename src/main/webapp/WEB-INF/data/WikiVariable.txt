__Variable evaluation order__

The variables are evaluated in the following order:
# 'Preset' variables (or constants), as those listed on this page.
# 'Context' variables, as those set by plugins and tags.
# 'Property' variables, like those set in jspwiki.properties.
# 'Page' variables, like those set using the "SET" directive.

!!!Defining Custom Variables
You can use the "SET" directive to define a variable that will exist only in the page.

For example:
{{{
  [{SET foo='bar'}]
}}}

creates you a variable called "foo", which has the value of "bar".  You can access this value anywhere on your page by using the shorthand "[[{$foo}]".


!!!Pre-defined Variables
ProcessLab also defines all kinds of other variables, and tags and plugins can also add their own variables.  The following variables are pre-defined:

!applicationname

This is the name of this Wiki.  It has been set by the administrator in "jspwiki.properties". This Wiki is called ''[{$applicationname}]''.

!baseurl

!encoding

Describes the character encoding used in this Wiki. An encoding of "UTF-8" means that the Wiki accepts any character, including Chinese, Japanese, etc.  Encoding "ISO-8859-1" means that only western languages are supported.  This wiki uses the ''[{$encoding}]'' encoding.
