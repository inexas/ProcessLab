The DataSourceList plugin generates a list of data sources that are currently configured.

If you need to create, delete or change the data source you need to visit the [Data star configuration|DataStar configuration] page but you need to be an Database Administrator (i.e. a member of the dbadmins group):

!!! Examples

!! Output as a table
[{DataSourceList}]

! Source
{{{
[{DataSourceList}]
}}}
or explicitly
{{{
[{DataSourceList format=table}]
}}}

!! Output as a list
The currently configured database data sources are: [{DataSourceList format=comma}].

! Source
{{{
The currently configured database data sources are: [{DataSourceList format=comma}].
}}}
