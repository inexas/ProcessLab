!!! Developing

For the moment I do not want to deploy the whole app as a web app, I will limit
myself to the Data* plugins.


!! Debugging
I have no idea how this works - but it does. I use Sysdeo to start and stop the server. I copied the
com directory from project/bin to the classes directory in WEB-INF and, somehow, I can breakpoint it,
change source, whatever and it works.

When it doesn't find the source file you just have to add the project
