/**
 * WatchDog is a general system watchdog. You can attach any Watchable or a
 * Thread object to it, and it will notify you if a timeout has been exceeded.
 * <p>
 * The notification of the timeouts is done from a separate WatchDog thread, of
 * which there is one per watched thread. This Thread is named 'WatchDog for
 * XXX', where XXX is your Thread name.
 * <p>
 * The suggested method of obtaining a WatchDog is via the static factory
 * method, since it will return you the correct watchdog for the current thread.
 * However, we do not prevent you from creating your own watchdogs either.
 * <p>
 * If you create a WatchDog for a Thread, the WatchDog will figure out when the
 * Thread is dead, and will stop itself accordingly. However, this object is not
 * automatically released, so you might want to check it out after a while.
 * 
 * @since 2.4.92
