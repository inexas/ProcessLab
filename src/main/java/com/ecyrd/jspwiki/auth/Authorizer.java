 * Authorizer to determine which additional
 * {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.Role} principals should be added to
 * the user's WikiSession. To determine which roles should be injected, the
 * Authorizer is queried for the roles it knows about by calling
 * {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.Authorizer#getRoles()}. Then, each role
 * returned by the Authorizer is tested by calling
 * {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.Authorizer#isUserInRole(WikiSession, Principal)}
 * . If this check fails, and the Authorizer is of type WebAuthorizer,
 * AuthenticationManager checks the role again by calling
 * {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.WebAuthorizer#isUserInRole(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, Principal)}
 * ). Any roles that pass the test are injected into the Subject by firing
 * appropriate authentication events.
