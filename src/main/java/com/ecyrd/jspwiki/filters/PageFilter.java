/**
 * Provides a definition for a page filter. A page filter is a class that can be
 * used to transform the WikiPage content being saved or being loaded at any
 * given time.
 * <p>
 * Note that the WikiContext.getPage() method always returns the context in
 * which text is rendered, i.e. the original request. Thus the content may
 * actually be different content than what what the wikiContext.getPage()
 * implies! This happens often if you are for example including multiple pages
 * on the same page.
 * <p>
 * PageFilters must be thread-safe! There is only one instance of each
 * PageFilter per each WikiEngine invocation. If you need to store data
 * persistently, use VariableManager, or WikiContext.
 * <p>
 * As of 2.5.30, initialize() gains access to the WikiEngine.
