ProcessLab README
=================

ProcessLab is an Enterprise Knowledge Management tool. It provides a central
repository to capture and exploit an organization's knowhow in terms of it's
unstructured data: text for example, structured data: customers or products
for example, and processes: order processing for example.

Whilst ProcessLab is open source: you have access to and can change the 
source code, in general it is not free. Please consult http://www.inexas.org/
for our terms and conditions.

Please pay your license fees. Inexas itself is a not-for-profit association
so by not paying your license fees you are not stealing from a company, you
are stealing from individuals like Lee, Michel and Johannes.
